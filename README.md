# Queen's Summer of Science Program 
For my final projects, I created a periodic table encyclopedia that provides statistical/numerical data on the first 20 elements in the table. 
<br></br>
For example, you can ask it to give you the chemical profile of Calcium and it will provide you with several numerical stats, including number of protons, atomic mass, discovery year of the element, boiling point, etc.

I made this game to educate myself on some of most important and fundamental elements we know of today, and to obviously teach myself how to work with large amounts of data on spreadsheets!
